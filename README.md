###zip_to_csv
	```python
	zip_to_csv(path:str)
	```

	**Convert a zipped `sql` -file into a `csv` -file**

	This function unpacks the given zip file at its location and invokes the given sql_to_csv
	function on the sql file, with the same name as the zip file
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the zip file with the sql in it, type `str` 

###zip_to_npy
	```python
	zip_to_npy(path:str)
	```

	**Convert a zipped `sql` -file into a `npy` -file**

	This function unpacks the given zip file at its location and invokes the given sql_to_npy
	function on the sql file, with the same name as the zip file
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the zip file with the sql in it, type `str`  

###sql_to_csv
	```python
	sql_to_csv(path:str, delimiter:str = '\n')
	```

	**Convert a set of INSERT statement into `csv` format**

	Extracting the Data from a set of INSERT statements saved in a sql file, this function
	converts the data into a csv file where every not INSERT line is saved in a separate pickle
	file and the data of the INSERT statements is stored line after line, with the given delimiter
	at the end of each line.

	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the sql file, type `str`  
	+ param **delimiter**: as the delimiter at the end of each line, type `str`  

###sql_to_npy
	```python
	sql_to_npy(path:str, delimiter:str = ',')
	```

	**Convert a set of INSERT statement into a numpy array**

	Similar to the csv this function also stores unused data in a pickle file and creates
	a brand new file with the extracted data, this time in an npy format, however this time
	the delimiter has to be the delimiter used in the sql file, as well as an additional 
	missing_values string used to represent missing data
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the sql file, type `str`  
	+ param **delimiter**: as the string used in the sql file to separate the data, type `str`  

##csvConversion

###csv_to_sql
	```python
	csv_to_sql(path:str, delimiter:str = '\n')
	```

	**Convert a `csv` file into a set of INSERT statements**
	
	This function converts each set of data divided by the given delimiter
	of a csv file into a INSERT statement it also adds data 
	stored in a pickle file, with the same name as the csv file,
	as a commentary at the beginning, as to not impede the functionality
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the csv file, type `str`  
	+ param **delimiter**: as the string used to detect the different data sets, type `str`  


###csv_to_npy
	```python
	csv_to_npy(path:str, delimiter:str = ',')
	```

	**Convert a `csv` file into a numpy array representation**

	This function converts a csv file into a 2-dimensional numpy representation,
	while every set of data divided by the given delimiter is interpreted as a new row

	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the csv file, type `str`  
	+ param **delimiter**: the string used to determine the rows of the numpy array, type `str`  

##npyConversion

###npy_to_sql
	```python
	npy_to_sql(path:str)
	```

	**Convert a `npy` file into a set of INSERT statements**

	this function is the reverse function to sql_to_npy and when used in conjuction
	you end up with the same file in the end as you had in the beginning

	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the npy file, type `str`  

###npy_to_csv
	```python
	npy_to_csv(path:str)
	```

	**Converts a `npy` file into a `csv` representation of the data**

	Similar to npy_to_sql this function is the reverse function to csv_to_npy
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the npy file, type `str`  

##Interpretation
	
###gen_GAF
	```python
	gen_GAF(path:str)
	```

	**Generate a Gramian Angular Field with User input**

	this function gets the input from the user through the console to generate
	either a Gramian Angular Summation Field or a Gramian Angular Difference Field
	from the data of a numpy array using the gen_GAF_exec function
	
	+ param **path**: as the absolute path to the npy file, type `str`  

###gen_GAF_exec
	```python
	gen_GAF_exec(data:list, sample_range:None or tuple = (-1,1), method:'summation'or'difference' = 'summation')
	```

	**Generate a Gramian angular Field**

	this is the actual function when it comes to generating a Gramian Angular Field
	out of the data of a numpy array. This function takes different variables to determine
	how the Field should be scaled, what its size should be 
	and if it is either a summation or difference Field
	
	+ param **data**: as the content of a npy file , type `list`  
	+ param **sample_range**: as the range the data should be scaled to, type `None` or `tuple`  
	+ param **method**: as the type of field it should be, type 'summation' or 'difference'

	```python
	false_imput(path:str)
	```
